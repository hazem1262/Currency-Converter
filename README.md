# Currency-Converter
Currency app is designed to helps customers to hand different currency conversions.

## Design Pattern
MVI design pattern as recommended in docs [guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) , with some modification to the network layer adding Kotlin coroutines, also using Hilt for dependency injection

## Used Technologies

* [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) for asynchronous programming
* [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection
* [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow)
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to bind data to ui
* [Retrofit] for networking
* [timper] for logging
* [customLogger] for logging formatting
* [Unit Testing] test business logic in view model
* [UI Testing] test compose components
